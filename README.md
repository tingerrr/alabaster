# alabaster
This is a convencience program for preparing typst packages for the time being where the cli has no
publish functionality.

It has only the bare minimum of error handling and is not actively developed. It may receive new
features as I need them. If you think this is worth maintaining feel free to open PRs to improve
the codebase.

See [hydra] for an example of it's usage and config options.
